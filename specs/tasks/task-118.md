## Spec Excerpt

From `agent-runtime.md` §1 Phases 4-8:

**Phase 4 — System Spawns Agents:**
Task scheduler detects `Backlog` tasks with `task_type: Implementation`. Checks ordering (`depends_on` complete, next `order` value). Preconditions: repo not Archived, under `max_agents` limit, workspace budget not exhausted. Then: sets task `InProgress`, creates agent record (`Active`), mints repo-scoped JWT, assembles prompt set (§2), creates worktree, provisions on compute target (§3), injects env vars.

**Phase 5 — Implementation:**
Agent works autonomously: reads task via MCP, edits files, runs tests, commits, pushes, calls `agent.complete`.

**Phase 6 — MR and Gates:**
On agent completion: server creates MR, gates run automatically (test, lint, spec review, trace capture). All results recorded on MR.

**Phase 7 — Ralph Loop:**
- Gates pass → MR merges, task Completed, agent Idle, JWT revoked
- Gates fail → gate failures written to agent inbox, server re-spawns agent (same persona, same meta-specs, fresh context), agent reads failures and re-implements. Loop until convergence or `max_iterations` (default 10, configurable per repo).
- Max iterations → task Blocked, agent Failed, `TaskBlocked` message to repo orchestrator
- Spawn failure → 3 retries with exponential backoff, then task Blocked + priority-1 notification
- Spec rejection mid-flight → cancel tasks, shutdown agents (60s grace)

**Phase 8 — System-Initiated Agents:**
- Gate reviewer: spawned when MR enters gate queue
- Interrogation: spawned on "Ask Why" click (30-min JWT TTL)
- Reconciliation: spawned on meta-spec change

## Implementation Plan

1. **Task scheduler service:**
   - Background service that polls for `Backlog` + `Implementation` tasks
   - Checks `depends_on` completion and `order` sequencing
   - Precondition checks: repo status, max_agents count, workspace budget
   - On eligible task: transition to `InProgress`, create agent, mint JWT, assemble prompts (via task-116), create worktree, spawn on compute target (via task-117)

2. **Agent lifecycle automation:**
   - Wire `agent.complete` handler to trigger MR creation
   - After MR creation, trigger gate execution
   - After gate execution, check results:
     - All pass → merge MR, mark task Done, mark agent Idle, revoke JWT
     - Any fail → write gate failure to agent inbox, re-spawn agent (fresh context)
   - Track iteration count on agent entity

3. **Ralph loop re-spawn:**
   - On gate failure: increment `iteration` on agent, check against `max_iterations`
   - If under limit: re-spawn with same persona + meta-specs + task, but fresh context
   - Gate failure messages delivered to agent inbox so new session reads them
   - If at limit: mark task `Blocked`, agent `Failed`, notify repo orchestrator

4. **Spawn failure handling:**
   - Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 5s, 30s)
   - All retries fail: task Blocked, priority-1 notification for workspace admins

5. **Spec rejection mid-flight:**
   - On `POST /specs/:path/reject`: cancel in-flight tasks with that spec_ref
   - Send shutdown message to active agents, 60s grace period
   - Cancel delegation task if any

6. **System-initiated agents:**
   - Gate reviewer: spawned by gate executor when spec-review gate runs
   - Interrogation agent: spawned by "Ask Why" endpoint
   - Reconciliation agent: spawned on meta-spec change publication

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task scheduler detects Implementation tasks and spawns agents mechanically
- [ ] Precondition checks: repo status, max_agents, budget
- [ ] Agent completion triggers MR creation and gate execution
- [ ] Ralph loop: gate failure → re-spawn with fresh context + failure messages in inbox
- [ ] Max iterations enforced (task Blocked, agent Failed, orchestrator notified)
- [ ] Spawn failure retry with exponential backoff (1s, 5s, 30s)
- [ ] Spec rejection cancels in-flight tasks and agents
- [ ] System-initiated agents: gate reviewer, interrogation, reconciliation
- [ ] `cargo test --all` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/agent-runtime.md` §1 Phases 4-8 in full. Agent spawn is in `gyre-server/src/api/spawn.rs`. Agent domain: `gyre-domain/src/agent.rs` (has `iteration`, `loop_config`). Task domain: `gyre-domain/src/task.rs` (has `task_type`, `order`, `depends_on`). Gate execution: `gyre-server/src/gate_executor.rs`. MR creation: grep for `create_mr` or `MergeRequest::new`. JWT minting: `gyre-server/src/auth.rs` or `gyre-server/src/signing.rs`. Compute target: `gyre-domain/src/compute_target.rs`.
