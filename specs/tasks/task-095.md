## Spec Excerpt

### Post-Merge Validation

After the merge processor merges an MR, a post-merge validation gate runs against the new HEAD of the default branch.

### Recovery Protocol

```
MR merged to main → Post-merge gate runs
  ├── PASS: continue. Merge queue processes next entry.
  └── FAIL:
        1. Merge queue PAUSES
        2. Forge creates a REVERT commit
        3. Post-merge gate re-runs on reverted HEAD
        4. Original MR re-opened with status `Reverted`
        5. Author agent receives RevertNotification via MCP
        6. Task created: "MR #{id} reverted: {failure reason}"
        7. MR's gate results invalidated
```

**MR Status Enum** gains `Reverted` variant.

### Agent Behavior During Recovery

Agents keep working — their branches need rebasing after main is fixed (jj handles automatically). Merge queue paused, workspace orchestrator notified.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Post-merge gate execution:**
   - After `merge_processor.rs` merges an MR, run configured post-merge gates
   - Add `post_merge_gates` to repo gate configuration (same schema as pre-merge gates)
   - Execute against HEAD of default branch after merge commit

2. **MR `Reverted` status:**
   - Add `Reverted` variant to `MrStatus` enum in domain
   - Migration to add "Reverted" to the status constraint (if using CHECK)

3. **Recovery protocol implementation:**
   - On post-merge gate failure:
     a. Pause the merge queue for the repo (`merge_queue_paused: bool` on repo state)
     b. Create revert commit using `git revert --no-edit <merge_sha>`
     c. Push revert to default branch
     d. Re-run post-merge gates on reverted HEAD
     e. If revert passes: resume merge queue, re-open original MR as `Reverted`
     f. If revert fails: escalate to human (critical notification)
   - Send `RevertNotification` message to author agent
   - Create remediation task referencing the failure reason

4. **Merge queue pause/resume:**
   - Add `paused: bool` and `pause_reason: Option<String>` to merge queue state
   - When paused, merge processor skips processing new entries
   - Resume clears the flag and triggers immediate queue processing

5. **Workspace orchestrator notification:**
   - Emit Event-tier message when merge queue pauses/resumes
   - Workspace orchestrator can reprioritize work accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Post-merge gates run after merge against new HEAD
- [x] `Reverted` variant added to MrStatus
- [x] Merge queue pauses on post-merge gate failure
- [x] Revert commit created and pushed automatically
- [x] Original MR re-opened as Reverted
- [x] Author agent receives RevertNotification
- [x] Remediation task created with failure reason
- [x] Merge queue resume works after main is green
- [x] `cargo test --all` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/platform-model.md` §6 "Rollback & Recovery". The merge processor is in `gyre-server/src/merge_processor.rs`. Gate execution is in `gyre-server/src/gate_executor.rs`. The MrStatus enum is in `gyre-domain/src/lib.rs` (or similar). For git revert operations, check how the forge executes git commands (likely via `gyre-server/src/git_http.rs` or a git helper). The merge queue state is managed in the merge processor — look for how queue entries are processed sequentially.
