## Spec Excerpt

system-explorer.md §6 defines an Architectural Timeline — a time-scrubber at the bottom of the canvas that lets the user see the system at any point in history.

**What changes as you scrub:**
- The canvas shows the knowledge graph at that point in time
- Ghost outlines show elements that have been added since (forward ghosts) or will be removed (backward ghosts)
- The sidebar shows the delta: "Between then and now: +12 types, -3 types, +2 traits, 8 types modified"

**Key moments** are marked on the timeline:
- Spec approvals (spec X approved → implementation began)
- Milestone completions
- Reconciliation events (persona v3 → v4)
- Major structural changes (new crate added, trait split)

Click a key moment → the delta panel shows what changed and why (narrative from the knowledge graph).

**Visual language:** The scrubber is a horizontal slider. Key moments are marked as dots/ticks on the timeline. The current position shows a date label. Ghost nodes use the same visual language as system-explorer.md §3 (dotted outlines).

## Implementation Plan

1. **Timeline scrubber component** (`TimelineScrubber.svelte`):
   - Horizontal range slider at the bottom of the canvas area
   - Date range: first commit → current date
   - Dragging updates the canvas to show the graph at that point in time
   - Current date label shown above the scrubber handle
   - Smooth scrubbing with debounced graph fetching (200ms debounce)

2. **Historical graph API**:
   - The knowledge graph needs to support point-in-time queries
   - Check if `GET /repos/:id/graph` accepts a `?at=<timestamp>` or `?commit=<sha>` parameter
   - If not, add a `?at=<iso-timestamp>` query parameter that filters the graph to nodes/edges that existed at that timestamp (based on `created_at` and `deleted_at` fields)

3. **Ghost node rendering**:
   - Nodes that exist now but didn't exist at the scrubbed time → forward ghosts (dotted green outline)
   - Nodes that existed at the scrubbed time but don't exist now → backward ghosts (dotted red outline with strikethrough)
   - Modified nodes (exist at both times but changed) → yellow highlight

4. **Delta panel**:
   - When scrubber is not at "now", show a delta summary panel
   - Count of added/removed/modified nodes by type
   - "Between [scrubbed date] and now: +12 types, -3 types, +2 traits, 8 types modified"
   - Collapsible, appears above or beside the scrubber

5. **Key moments markers**:
   - Fetch key events from the timeline: spec approvals, milestone completions, reconciliation events
   - Show as colored dots on the scrubber track
   - Hover → tooltip with event description
   - Click → delta panel shows what changed at that moment

6. **Tests**:
   - Scrubber renders with correct date range
   - Debounced graph fetch on scrub
   - Ghost nodes rendered correctly for historical views
   - Delta summary counts match expected values
   - Key moment markers appear at correct positions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Timeline scrubber appears at bottom of canvas
- [ ] Dragging scrubber updates canvas to show historical graph state
- [ ] Ghost outlines for nodes added since (green dotted) and removed (red dotted)
- [ ] Delta summary panel shows added/removed/modified counts
- [ ] Key moments marked on timeline (spec approvals, milestones, reconciliations)
- [ ] Click key moment shows delta narrative
- [ ] Scrubber at "now" position shows current graph (no ghosts)
- [ ] Tests pass

## Agent Instructions

Read `system-explorer.md` §6 "Architectural Timeline" for the full specification. The canvas is built in task-178 — check `ExplorerView.svelte` for how to add the scrubber below the canvas. For historical graph queries, check `graph.rs` for existing query parameters on `GET /repos/:id/graph`. The ghost node visual language should match the ghost overlay styles defined in `system-explorer.md` §3 (dotted outlines, color coding). Key moments data may need a new endpoint or could be derived from existing spec approval and milestone data — check `specs.rs` for approval history and the spec lifecycle events. The `timeline` layout type is already in the view spec grammar (task-170) — the timeline scrubber is a different feature (it controls the temporal state of any layout, not a layout type itself).
