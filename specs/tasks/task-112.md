## Spec Excerpt

From `user-management.md` §Delivery Channels:

```rust
pub struct NotificationChannels {
    pub in_app: bool,           // Always true (can't disable)
    pub email: EmailConfig,
    pub webhook: Option<WebhookConfig>,
    pub slack: Option<SlackConfig>,
}

pub struct EmailConfig {
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub digest: DigestFrequency,
    pub min_priority: NotificationPriority,
}

pub struct WebhookConfig {
    pub url: String,
    pub secret: String,            // HMAC-SHA256 signing secret
    pub min_priority: NotificationPriority,
}

pub struct SlackConfig {
    pub webhook_url: String,
    pub channel: Option<String>,
    pub min_priority: NotificationPriority,
}
```

From §Who Gets Notified — routing table mapping events to recipients (spec approval → approvers, agent escalation → spawning user + workspace admins, gate failure → MR author, etc.).

From §Notification Routing for Agent Escalations:
1. Check agent's `spawned_by` user — primary recipient
2. If offline, also notify workspace Admins
3. For `Urgent` priority: always notify workspace Owners

## Implementation Plan

1. **Extend domain types in `gyre-domain`:**
   - Update `NotificationChannels` to include `email: EmailConfig`, `webhook: Option<WebhookConfig>`, `slack: Option<SlackConfig>`
   - Add `EmailConfig`, `WebhookConfig`, `SlackConfig` structs
   - Add `NotificationPriority` enum (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) if not present

2. **Notification dispatcher service:**
   - Create a `NotificationDispatcher` in `gyre-server` that receives a notification and routes it to configured channels
   - For each channel, check `min_priority` threshold before sending
   - In-app delivery: create notification record (existing path)
   - Email delivery: format notification into email template, queue for send (use lettre or similar, or HTTP-based email API)
   - Webhook delivery: POST JSON payload to configured URL, sign with HMAC-SHA256
   - Slack delivery: POST to Slack incoming webhook URL

3. **Notification routing engine:**
   - Implement the routing table from §Who Gets Notified
   - For each event type, resolve the list of recipient user IDs
   - For agent escalations: check `spawned_by`, check active sessions for online status, escalate to workspace admins/owners as needed

4. **Notification preferences API:**
   - `GET /api/v1/notifications/preferences` — current user's channel preferences
   - `PUT /api/v1/notifications/preferences` — update preferences
   - Store as part of `UserPreferences` or separate table

5. **Wire into domain event handlers:**
   - When domain events fire (gate failure, budget warning, spec approval, etc.), call the notification dispatcher
   - Map `MessageKind` events to `NotificationType` and resolve recipients

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `NotificationChannels` extended with email, webhook, Slack configs
- [ ] `NotificationDispatcher` routes to all configured channels
- [ ] Webhook delivery signs payload with HMAC-SHA256
- [ ] Slack delivery posts to incoming webhook
- [ ] Email delivery queues messages (at minimum, the interface — actual SMTP can be stubbed)
- [ ] Routing table maps events to correct recipients per spec
- [ ] Agent escalation routing checks online status and escalates
- [ ] Notification preferences API (GET/PUT)
- [ ] Priority threshold filtering works per channel
- [ ] `cargo test --all` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/user-management.md` §Delivery Channels, §Who Gets Notified, §Notification Routing for Agent Escalations. Existing notification model is in `gyre-domain/src/notification.rs` and `gyre-common/src/notification.rs`. User preferences are in `gyre-domain/src/user.rs` (`UserPreferences` struct, `NotificationChannels`). Check the existing notification creation paths — grep for `Notification::new` or `create_notification`. Domain events are in `gyre-server/src/domain_events.rs`. Route registration in `api/mod.rs`. ABAC mappings in `abac_middleware.rs`.
