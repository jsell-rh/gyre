## Spec Excerpt

From `specs/system/spec-registry.md` §16 (Integration → Agent Gates):

> The `gates:` field in the manifest feeds the gate chain:
> - MR references `system/identity-security.md` -> manifest says gates = [security, accountability]
> - Forge spawns security gate agent and accountability gate agent for this MR
> - Different specs can require different gate agents
>
> The spec approval ledger in agent-gates.md is now unified with the forge ledger described here. One table, one source of truth.

Manifest schema (§Agent Approver / Gate Schema): each gate entry carries `persona`, `min_attestation_level` (default 1), and optional `stack_hash`.

## Problem

Hollow. `trigger_gates_for_mr()` (`crates/gyre-server/src/gate_executor.rs:23-60`) sources gates **only** from repo-level configuration: `state.quality_gates.list_by_repo_id(repo_id)`. The manifest's per-spec `gates:` (`GateConfig` on `SpecEntry`, `crates/gyre-server/src/spec_registry.rs:107,181-186`) are parsed but **never consumed anywhere**. An MR carrying `spec_ref = "specs/system/identity-security.md@<sha>"` does not get the `[security, accountability]` gate agents its manifest entry declares — per-spec gate selection is unimplemented.

`trigger_gates_for_mr` is invoked from `crates/gyre-server/src/api/merge_queue.rs:77` with the MR's `repository_id`. The MR's `spec_ref` (`MergeRequest.spec_ref`, `crates/gyre-domain/src/merge_request.rs:77`) has the form `"path@sha"`.

## Implementation Plan

1. In `trigger_gates_for_mr` (or a helper it calls), load the MR (`state.merge_requests.find_by_id`) to read `spec_ref`. If `spec_ref` is `Some("path@sha")`, split off the path and SHA.

2. Read the manifest for the MR's repo at that spec SHA (or repo HEAD if you determine HEAD is the correct policy source — match the approach task-193 uses for reading policy; prefer the spec SHA embedded in `spec_ref` so gates reflect the exact reviewed version): `crate::spec_registry::read_manifest(repo_path, sha)` (helper from task-193). Resolve `repo_path` from `repo_id` via `state.repos`.

3. Find the manifest `SpecEntry` matching the spec_ref path (normalize `specs/`-prefix consistently). For each `GateConfig` in `entry.gates`, materialize a gate to run for this MR:
   - Map each manifest gate `{persona, min_attestation_level, stack_hash}` onto the existing gate-execution machinery. Reuse the `QualityGate` / `GateResult` flow already in `gate_executor.rs` (create a `Pending` `GateResult`, then run an agent-review/validation gate for the named persona). Do NOT invent a parallel results table — the merge-blocking check `check_gates_for_mr` (gate_executor.rs:837) must see these results.
   - The gate must actually enforce the persona: spawn/run the agent gate for that persona (reuse `run_agent_review_gate` / the persona-driven path), not the auto-pass stub, when a persona is configured. Carry `min_attestation_level` / `stack_hash` into the gate so the reviewing agent's attestation can be constrained (mirror how task-193 validates agent approvals; if the current gate machinery has no attestation constraint plumbing, wire the minimum needed to record and enforce it — do not silently drop the constraint).

4. **Union, don't replace:** keep running repo-level `quality_gates` gates as today, and additionally run the manifest per-spec gates. Deduplicate if a repo-level gate and a manifest gate target the same persona to avoid double-spawning.

5. If the MR has no `spec_ref`, or the repo has no manifest, or the entry declares no `gates`, behavior is unchanged (repo-level gates only).

## Acceptance Criteria

- An MR whose `spec_ref` points at a spec whose manifest entry declares `gates: [security, accountability]` results in gate executions for **both** personas (visible as `GateResult` rows for the MR), in addition to any repo-level gates.
- An MR with no `spec_ref` (or a repo with no manifest) runs exactly the repo-level gates it runs today — no regression, no spurious gates.
- Manifest gates and repo-level gates targeting the same persona do not double-run.
- A configured manifest gate with a persona runs the real persona-driven gate path (not the always-pass stub) and its pass/fail participates in `check_gates_for_mr` merge-blocking.
- A test (in `gate_executor.rs` tests) that FAILS if manifest-gate sourcing is removed: with a fixture manifest declaring per-spec gates and an MR referencing that spec, `trigger_gates_for_mr` (or the extracted selection helper) yields gate executions for the manifest personas. Prefer extracting the "which gates apply to this MR?" resolution into a pure helper `(Option<&SpecManifest>, mr) -> Vec<GateSpec>` and asserting on it directly.
- `cargo build --all`, touched-crate tests, and `bash scripts/check-arch.sh` pass.

## Agent Instructions

- Reuse `crate::spec_registry::read_manifest` from task-193; do not add another manifest reader.
- Reuse the existing `GateResult`/`check_gates_for_mr` flow so merge-blocking sees manifest gates — do NOT build a separate gate path that the merge processor can't observe.
- Do NOT satisfy the manifest gate with the auto-pass stub when a persona is configured; run the real persona gate.
- Extract gate selection into a pure, unit-testable helper; assert on the resolved gate set, not merely that "some gate ran".
- Run only touched-crate tests plus `scripts/check-arch.sh`; skip formatters and the full suite.
