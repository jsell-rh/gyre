## Spec Excerpt

system-explorer.md §8 defines Conversational Exploration — an AI-assisted mode where the human asks questions and the system answers from the knowledge graph:

**Example interaction:**
> Q: "Why does SearchService implement both FullTextPort and CachePort?"
> A: "SearchService was initially created to implement search.md (commit abc, agent worker-7). CachePort was added during performance-optimization.md reconciliation (commit def, agent worker-12)..."

The answer is **grounded in the knowledge graph**: provenance records, spec linkage, architectural timeline. The LLM synthesizes, but every claim is traceable to an artifact.

**Follow-up capabilities:**
- "Show me other services that also implement CachePort" → canvas highlights matching nodes
- "What would happen if I removed CachePort from SearchService?" → structural prediction shows impact (ghost overlays from §3)

**Grounding requirements:** Every claim in the LLM's response must reference a concrete artifact (commit SHA, spec path, node ID, agent name). The UI should render these as clickable links that navigate to the referenced entity.

**Data flow:** The conversational Q&A uses the Ask input in the Explorer control bar. Questions are sent to an LLM with knowledge graph context. Responses can include both text answers AND canvas updates (highlight specific nodes, generate a view spec).

## Implementation Plan

1. **Conversational Q&A panel** (`ConversationalExplorer.svelte`):
   - Expandable panel triggered from the Ask input in the control bar
   - Chat-style interface: user question → system response
   - Conversation history maintained in component state (not persisted)
   - Each response can include: text answer, entity references, canvas actions

2. **Backend: Q&A endpoint integration**:
   - Uses the existing Ask input mechanism from task-178
   - For questions that need knowledge graph grounding, the LLM prompt includes:
     - Current graph summary (nodes, edges, types)
     - Provenance data for mentioned entities
     - Spec linkage for mentioned entities
     - Architectural timeline events
   - Response format: text with embedded entity references `[entity:type:id]`

3. **Entity reference rendering**:
   - Parse entity references from LLM response text
   - Render as clickable inline links (styled distinctly from regular text)
   - Click → navigates to the entity in the detail panel or highlights on canvas
   - Types: commit (link to git), spec (open inline), node (highlight on canvas), agent (show provenance)

4. **Canvas integration**:
   - "Show me X" type responses → generate a view spec and apply to canvas
   - "What would happen if..." → trigger structural prediction (ghost overlays from task-186)
   - Highlighting: when response references specific nodes, those nodes pulse on the canvas
   - The canvas responds to conversation context

5. **Follow-up context**:
   - Each follow-up question includes the conversation history
   - The LLM can reference previous answers and build on them
   - "Show me other services" knows which service was discussed

6. **Tests**:
   - Q&A panel renders questions and responses
   - Entity references in responses are clickable
   - Canvas highlights nodes mentioned in responses
   - Follow-up questions maintain conversation context
   - View spec generation from conversational queries works

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Conversational Q&A panel accessible from Ask input in control bar
- [ ] Questions sent with knowledge graph context to LLM
- [ ] Responses grounded in knowledge graph with traceable entity references
- [ ] Entity references rendered as clickable links
- [ ] Click entity reference → navigate to entity or highlight on canvas
- [ ] Follow-up questions maintain conversation context
- [ ] "Show me X" responses update the canvas view
- [ ] "What would happen if..." responses trigger structural predictions
- [ ] Tests pass

## Agent Instructions

Read `system-explorer.md` §8 "Conversational Exploration" for the full specification. The Ask input in the control bar is built in task-178 and connects to `POST /workspaces/:id/explorer-views/generate`. For conversational exploration, the response may be a text answer rather than a view spec — check how the generate endpoint handles questions that cannot produce a view spec (the spec says `{view_spec: null, explanation: "..."}` pattern). The knowledge graph context should include provenance data — check `graph.rs` for how nodes include `spec_path`, `created_by`, `last_modified_by` fields. For structural prediction integration, use the predict endpoint from task-186. The LLM prompt template at `specs/prompts/explorer-generate.md` may need to be extended to support Q&A-style questions alongside view generation.
