## Authority and Scope

`ui-navigation.md` explicitly supersedes `human-system-interface.md` §1,
including the six-item sidebar and its 6×3 content matrix. The original
task-083 plan targeted that superseded matrix. Implement scope-aware content
in the current workspace-home / repo-mode navigation instead. The deeper HSI
§2–§12 behaviors remain valid; this task changes their navigation and scoping,
not their underlying requirements.

Task-082 is historical shell work, not an instruction to restore its obsolete
sidebar. Preserve the canonical shell restored by the main-baseline repair.

## Required Behavior

1. **Cross-workspace view (`/all`, §10):** Show the Decisions, Workspaces,
   Specs, Briefing, and Agent Rules sections for workspaces the caller can
   access. Preserve workspace/repo attribution on aggregated items; opening
   an item must enter its actual owning scope. Briefing aggregates the real
   per-workspace API results. Tenant settings and tenant-rule editing retain
   their authorization gates.
2. **Workspace home (`/workspaces/:slug`, §2):** Decisions, Specs, Architecture,
   Repos, Briefing, and Agent Rules use the selected workspace's real data.
   A repo or spec click carries the owning repo into repo mode. Rules merge
   the actual Global/Workspace sources. Settings and rule management use the
   canonical workspace routes, not a sidebar or fabricated scope identity.
3. **Repo mode (§3, §7):** Specs is the default landing tab; Architecture,
   Decisions, Code, and Settings are independently addressable tabs for the
   selected repo. Repo Decisions filter by the actual repo; workspace-only
   notifications are not silently assigned to a repo. Agent/entity drill-downs
   preserve the selected workspace/repo and the back path.
4. **Scope transitions:** Use client-side navigation with URL/history support.
   After switching scopes, a delayed response from the old scope must not
   overwrite the new scope's content. Lookup/request errors must surface as
   errors, rather than successful empty data or fallback scope identities.

## Acceptance and Verification

- [ ] Cross-workspace attribution links enter the item's owning workspace/repo.
- [ ] Workspace sections and repo tabs issue queries for their selected scope.
- [ ] Repo-mode entry defaults to Specs; deep links and back navigation retain scope.
- [ ] Delayed old-scope responses cannot replace current-scope content.
- [ ] Scoped request failures are visible and recoverable.
- [ ] The canonical shell and mobile workspace-section navigation remain intact.
- [ ] Existing meaningful navigation tests pass; add a regression only for a
  demonstrated missing behavior, with real API arguments and rendered results.

Read `docs/ui.md`, the cited navigation sections, and the actual routing/data
loaders before editing. Reuse working behavior. Do not introduce the permanent
sidebar, legacy scope breadcrumb control, or Architecture-as-default routing
from the superseded plan. Do not mark unrelated partial navigation features
verified as a side effect of this task.
