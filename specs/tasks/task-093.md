## Spec Excerpt

### Workspace Orchestrator

One per workspace. Sees all repos. Handles cross-repo concerns. Uses the `workspace-orchestrator` persona.

**Responsibilities:**
- Observe cross-repo state (blocked repos, dependency chains, budget usage)
- Resolve cross-repo conflicts (two repos competing for same shared library change)
- Route cross-repo work requests (Repo A needs X from Repo B)
- Enforce the spec escalation protocol
- Allocate budget across repos when contention exists
- Spawn/restart repo orchestrators

**Token scope:** workspace-level. Can read all repos, create cross-repo tasks and MR dependencies, communicate with all repo orchestrators.

### Repo Orchestrator

One per repo. Manages the Ralph loop for its repo. Uses the `repo-orchestrator` persona.

**Responsibilities:**
- Run the Ralph loop: observe, plan, dispatch, monitor, reconcile
- Decompose specs into tasks
- Spawn worker agents with scoped tokens
- Manage the repo's merge queue
- Escalate cross-repo needs to the Workspace Orchestrator

**Token scope:** repo-level. Can spawn agents, manage tasks/MRs, interact with the forge — all within its repo.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Orchestrator agent type in domain model:**
   - Add `OrchestratorType` enum to `Agent` domain entity: `WorkspaceOrchestrator`, `RepoOrchestrator`, `Worker` (default)
   - The `SpawnAgentRequest` already has `agent_type` (used for interrogation) — extend it to support `"workspace-orchestrator"` and `"repo-orchestrator"`
   - Workspace orchestrator gets workspace-scoped JWT; repo orchestrator gets repo-scoped JWT

2. **Workspace orchestrator spawning:**
   - Add `POST /api/v1/workspaces/:id/orchestrator/spawn` endpoint (or extend existing spawn)
   - Validates: only one workspace orchestrator active per workspace at a time
   - Uses `workspace-orchestrator` persona (must exist and be approved)
   - JWT has workspace scope (can read all repos in workspace)
   - Creates appropriate DerivedInput from the workspace's authorization chain

3. **Repo orchestrator spawning:**
   - Workspace orchestrator (or human via API) can spawn repo orchestrators
   - `POST /api/v1/repos/:id/orchestrator/spawn` or via standard spawn with type
   - Validates: only one repo orchestrator active per repo at a time
   - Uses `repo-orchestrator` persona
   - JWT has repo scope

4. **Orchestrator restart on failure:**
   - If a workspace orchestrator's agent dies (stale agent detector), auto-restart it
   - If a repo orchestrator dies, the workspace orchestrator is notified and can restart it
   - Add `restart_on_failure: bool` field to agent config

5. **Orchestrator-specific MCP tools:**
   - Workspace orchestrator: `gyre_spawn_repo_orchestrator`, `gyre_list_repo_orchestrators`, `gyre_cross_repo_task`
   - Repo orchestrator: `gyre_decompose_spec`, `gyre_spawn_worker` (existing tools but with validation)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OrchestratorType enum added to Agent domain
- [ ] Workspace orchestrator spawn endpoint validates one-per-workspace
- [ ] Workspace orchestrator gets workspace-scoped JWT
- [ ] Repo orchestrator spawn validates one-per-repo
- [ ] Repo orchestrator gets repo-scoped JWT
- [ ] Stale orchestrator auto-restart works
- [ ] Workspace orchestrator can spawn repo orchestrators via MCP
- [ ] `cargo test --all` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/platform-model.md` §3 "Two-Level Orchestration" for the full spec. The agent spawn flow is in `gyre-server/src/api/spawn.rs`. The existing `agent_type` field handles "interrogation" — extend it. The `workspace-orchestrator` and `repo-orchestrator` personas should be registered as built-in personas (see `gyre-domain/src/policy.rs` builtin_policies pattern). JWT minting is in the spawn flow — workspace-scoped JWTs need workspace_id in claims without repo restriction.
