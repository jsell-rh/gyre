# TASK-011: Spec Save Git Write-Through

**Spec reference:** `ui-layout.md` §3 (LLM-Assisted Spec Editing, Save workflow), `human-system-interface.md` §3 (Explorer: Inline Spec Editing)
**Depends on:** None (consumes existing git_ops port and notification system)
**Progress:** `ready-for-review`

## Spec Excerpt

From `ui-layout.md` §3:

> **Save workflow:** clicking Save commits the spec change to a feature branch named `spec-edit/<spec_path_slug>-<short_uuid>` [...] The server creates the branch, commits the change, and auto-creates an MR targeting the default branch. The MR itself creates a priority-2 "Spec pending approval" notification.

> The save endpoint: `POST /api/v1/repos/:repo_id/specs/save` — request: `{spec_path, content, message}`, response: `{branch, mr_id}`.

> If the user has an existing open `spec-edit/*` MR for the same `spec_path` [...] the save appends a commit to the existing branch rather than creating a new one.

From `ui-layout.md` §3 (prompts):

> Prompt templates use a separate endpoint: `POST /api/v1/repos/:repo_id/prompts/save` — request: `{prompt_path, content, message}`, response: `{commit_sha}`. This commits directly to the default branch (no feature branch, no MR, no approval notification).

## Current State

The `specs/save` handler (`crates/gyre-server/src/api/specs_assist.rs`) exists but the actual git operations are stubbed:
- Branch creation is stubbed (returns a fake branch name)
- File write is stubbed ("git_ops port does not yet expose a write-file method")
- MR creation is stubbed (returns a placeholder MR ID)
- Notification creation uses placeholder IDs
- The `prompts/save` handler is similarly stubbed (returns a fake commit SHA)
- Existing-MR detection (append commit to existing branch) is stubbed

## Implementation Plan

1. **Extend `GitOpsPort` with write operations:**
   - `write_file(repo_path, branch, file_path, content, message) -> Result<String>` (returns commit SHA)
   - `create_branch(repo_path, branch_name, from_ref) -> Result<()>`
   - `branch_exists(repo_path, branch_name) -> Result<bool>`
   - These belong in `gyre-ports/src/git_ops.rs` (existing port trait)

2. **Implement write operations in the git2 adapter:**
   - `crates/gyre-adapters/src/git2_ops.rs` already implements `GitOpsPort`
   - Add branch creation (via `git2::Repository::branch`)
   - Add file write (tree builder → commit → update ref)

3. **Wire `specs/save` handler to use real git operations:**
   - Resolve repo path from `repo_id` via `RepositoryPort`
   - Create `spec-edit/<slug>-<hash>` branch from default branch
   - Write spec content to `spec_path` on the branch
   - Create MR targeting default branch via `MergeRequestPort`
   - Create priority-2 notification for workspace Admin/Developer members
   - Handle existing-MR case: detect open `spec-edit/*` MR for same spec, append commit

4. **Wire `prompts/save` handler:**
   - Write to default branch directly (no feature branch, no MR)
   - Return real commit SHA

5. **Add tests:**
   - Spec save creates branch + MR + notification
   - Spec save with existing MR appends commit
   - Prompts save commits to default branch
   - Slug generation is deterministic

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `POST /api/v1/repos/:repo_id/specs/save` creates a real `spec-edit/*` branch with the spec content
- [ ] An MR is auto-created targeting the default branch
- [ ] A priority-2 "Spec pending approval" notification is created for workspace members
- [ ] Saving to an existing open spec-edit MR appends a commit instead of creating a new branch
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/repos/:repo_id/prompts/save` commits directly to the default branch
- [ ] Slug generation follows the spec: path → lowercase, `/` → `-`, strip `.md`, append 4-char hash
- [ ] Tests cover all acceptance criteria

## Agent Instructions

When working on this task:
1. Update the progress field above to `in-progress`
2. Read `crates/gyre-server/src/api/specs_assist.rs` for the current stubbed handlers
3. Read `crates/gyre-ports/src/git_ops.rs` for the existing `GitOpsPort` trait
4. Read `crates/gyre-adapters/src/git2_ops.rs` for the git2-based adapter
5. Read `crates/gyre-ports/src/merge_request.rs` for MR creation
6. Read `crates/gyre-ports/src/notification.rs` for notification creation
7. Implement the git write operations, then wire the handlers
8. On completion, update progress to `ready-for-review` and list git commits below
