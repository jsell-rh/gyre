## Spec Excerpt

The Editor Split layout (ui-layout.md §2) is used by meta-specs preview loop and spec editing with preview. It has two panels:

**Left panel** — spec or meta-spec editor with two modes:
- Manual edit: standard markdown editor with toolbar
- LLM chat: inline input below editor. User types instruction → LLM produces draft revision shown as inline diff block with Accept/Edit/Dismiss buttons

**Right panel** — preview of architectural impact:
- Architecture tab (default): structural diff from knowledge graph — added/modified/removed nodes
- Code Diff tab: traditional line-level diff of agent implementation on throwaway branch

The detail panel "pops out to full width" (Pop Out mechanism from §2 Split layout) and switches to Editor Split when the user clicks "Preview" in the spec detail panel.

Three states: Editing → Preview Running → Preview Complete (with Iterate option).

## Implementation Plan

1. **EditorSplit.svelte component** (`web/src/components/`):
   - Two-panel layout: left (editor, 50%) + right (preview, 50%)
   - Left panel: markdown textarea with toolbar + LLM chat input
   - Right panel: tabs for Architecture (default) and Code Diff
   - Inline diff block component with Accept/Edit/Dismiss buttons
   - State machine: editing → preview_running → preview_complete

2. **Pop Out integration**:
   - The existing DetailPanel's "Pop Out" mechanism should transition to EditorSplit
   - Back/Esc returns to normal detail panel view

3. **LLM draft revision display**:
   - Inline diff block component showing suggested changes
   - Accept: applies changes to editor content (in-memory, not committed)
   - Edit: copies suggested text into editor
   - Dismiss: removes suggestion

4. **Preview states**:
   - Editing: editor active, preview panel shows target spec selector
   - Preview Running: editor locked, progress indicators per spec
   - Preview Complete: Architecture delta + Code Diff tabs

5. **Tests**:
   - Component tests for state transitions
   - Accept/Edit/Dismiss button behaviors
   - Pop-out and return navigation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EditorSplit component renders two-panel layout
- [ ] Left panel supports manual edit and LLM chat modes
- [ ] Right panel has Architecture and Code Diff tabs
- [ ] Inline diff blocks with Accept/Edit/Dismiss work correctly
- [ ] State machine handles editing → running → complete → iterate cycle
- [ ] Pop Out from DetailPanel transitions to EditorSplit
- [ ] Back/Esc returns to normal view
- [ ] Tests pass

## Agent Instructions

Read `ui-layout.md` §2 "Editor Split" and §9 "Meta-specs Preview Loop Layout" for the full interaction design including all three states. Check the existing `MetaSpecs.svelte` component — it may already have partial editor functionality. The EditorSplit is used by BOTH spec editing and meta-spec editing; build it as a reusable component. The meta-spec preview loop layout (§9) shows the exact wireframes for States 1-3.
