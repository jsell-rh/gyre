## Spec Excerpt

### §AIBOM Contents (supply-chain.md)

The AIBOM (AI Bill of Materials) captures which AI models, prompts, and tools produced each commit. For releases, the AIBOM should be generated as a structured artifact (JSON) suitable for compliance review.

### §SLSA Provenance Integration (supply-chain.md)

Map Gyre's attestation chain to SLSA (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) framework. Level 2 requires: version-controlled build process, authenticated provenance. Level 3 requires: hermetic, reproducible builds.

### §The Laptop Problem (supply-chain.md)

When agents run on developer laptops (Level 2), the stack can drift between attestation and push. The forge should detect this drift and maintain an audit trail of overrides.

## Implementation Plan

1. **AIBOM release artifacts**: Extend the existing `GET /api/v1/repos/:id/aibom` endpoint to support `?format=release` that produces a structured JSON document suitable for packaging alongside release artifacts. Include: all agents that contributed commits, their model contexts, attestation levels, conversation SHAs, and the chain attestation data.

2. **SLSA provenance mapping**: Create a `GET /api/v1/repos/:id/slsa-provenance` endpoint that maps the existing provenance data to the SLSA provenance attestation format (in-toto v1). Map Gyre's attestation levels to SLSA Build Levels: Level 1 (raw push) = SLSA 0, Level 2 (CLI) = SLSA 1-2, Level 3 (managed) = SLSA 3.

3. **Laptop problem mitigation**: 
   - On push, if the agent's submitted stack hash differs from the `gyre-stack.lock` committed in the repo, record a `StackDriftEvent` in the audit log
   - If the push is allowed (Warn mode), require the agent to include a `stack_override_reason` field
   - Store override events with full context for compliance review
   - Add `GET /api/v1/repos/:id/stack-drift` endpoint to query drift history

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AIBOM release artifact format generates structured JSON with full agent attribution
- [ ] SLSA provenance endpoint maps to in-toto attestation format
- [ ] Stack drift detection on push creates audit events
- [ ] Override reason required when stack drift is detected in Warn mode
- [ ] Stack drift history queryable via API
- [ ] `cargo test --all` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/supply-chain.md` §"AIBOM Contents", §"SLSA Provenance Integration", and §"The Laptop Problem". The existing AIBOM endpoint is in `crates/gyre-server/src/aibom.rs` (or `api/aibom.rs`). The provenance data is in `api/provenance.rs` and `api/agent_tracking.rs`. The audit system is in `api/audit.rs`. For SLSA format, reference the in-toto attestation specification.
