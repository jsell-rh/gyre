## Spec Excerpt

From `abac-policy-engine.md` §Core Concepts through §Policy Examples:

**Attributes** — four categories evaluated on every access decision:

- **Subject attributes:** type, id, tenant_id, global_role, workspace_role, workspace_ids, team_ids, persona, stack_hash, attestation_level, repo_scope
- **Resource attributes:** type, id, tenant_id, workspace_id, repo_id, owner, team, approval_status, visibility
- **Action attributes:** read, write, delete, approve, spawn, push, merge, escalate, generate
- **Environment attributes:** time, ip, budget_remaining, main_health

**Policy Entity:**

```rust
pub struct Policy {
    pub id: Id,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub scope: PolicyScope,
    pub scope_id: Option<Id>,
    pub priority: u32,
    pub effect: PolicyEffect,
    pub conditions: Vec<Condition>,
    pub actions: Vec<String>,
    pub resource_types: Vec<String>,
    pub enabled: bool,
    pub immutable: bool,
    pub created_by: Id,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub updated_at: u64,
}

pub enum PolicyScope { Tenant, Workspace, Repo }
pub enum PolicyEffect { Allow, Deny }
```

**Conditions:**

```rust
pub struct Condition {
    pub attribute: String,        // e.g., "subject.workspace_role"
    pub operator: ConditionOp,
    pub value: ConditionValue,
}

pub enum ConditionOp {
    Equals, NotEquals, In, NotIn, GreaterThan, LessThan, Contains, Exists,
}

pub enum ConditionValue {
    String(String),
    StringList(Vec<String>),
    Number(i64),
    Bool(bool),
}
```

Conditions support dynamic references (e.g., `"$resource.repo_id"`) for comparing subject attributes against resource attributes at evaluation time.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Audit existing ABAC implementation:**
   - `gyre-server/src/abac.rs` and `abac_middleware.rs` — check current approach
   - `gyre-domain/src/policy.rs` — existing Policy entity
   - `gyre-server/src/policy_engine.rs` — existing evaluation
   - Determine gap between current implementation and spec

2. **Domain types in `gyre-domain`:**
   - Update/create `Policy` struct to match spec exactly
   - Add `PolicyScope` enum (Tenant, Workspace, Repo)
   - Add `PolicyEffect` enum (Allow, Deny)
   - Add `Condition` struct with `ConditionOp` and `ConditionValue`
   - Add `immutable` field for non-overridable deny policies

3. **Attribute model:**
   - Define `SubjectAttributes` struct collecting all subject attributes
   - Define `ResourceAttributes` struct
   - Define `EnvironmentAttributes` struct
   - Attribute extraction from auth context (JWT claims, memberships)

4. **Port trait in `gyre-ports`:**
   - `PolicyRepository` — CRUD + list by scope + find applicable policies for a scope chain

5. **SQLite adapter:**
   - Migration for `policies` table matching spec schema
   - Conditions stored as JSON array
   - Actions and resource_types stored as JSON arrays
   - Implement PolicyRepository

6. **Dynamic references in conditions:**
   - Support `$resource.repo_id` syntax in condition values
   - Resolve at evaluation time by substituting from resource attributes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Policy entity matches spec (all fields including immutable, scope, conditions)
- [ ] PolicyScope: Tenant, Workspace, Repo
- [ ] PolicyEffect: Allow, Deny
- [ ] Condition with all 8 ConditionOp variants
- [ ] ConditionValue: String, StringList, Number, Bool
- [ ] Dynamic references (`$resource.*`, `$subject.*`) resolve at evaluation time
- [ ] PolicyRepository port trait with CRUD + scope-based listing
- [ ] SQLite adapter with migration
- [ ] Subject/Resource/Environment attribute extraction from auth context
- [ ] `cargo test --all` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/abac-policy-engine.md` §Core Concepts through §Policy Examples. Existing ABAC: `gyre-server/src/abac.rs`, `abac_middleware.rs`, `policy_engine.rs`. Existing Policy domain: `gyre-domain/src/policy.rs`. Existing Policy port: `gyre-ports/src/policy.rs`. Existing Policy adapter: `gyre-adapters/src/sqlite/policy.rs`. Auth context: `gyre-server/src/auth.rs` for how subject attributes are extracted from JWTs. Check migration numbering: `ls crates/gyre-adapters/migrations/ | tail -5` — currently at 000049.
