## Spec Excerpt

From `meta-spec-reconciliation.md` §9 — Merge Gate Behavior:

> When an MR enters the merge queue, the merge processor checks whether the code was produced under the current meta-spec set version:
>
> - If `meta_spec_set_sha` on the MR's attestation matches the workspace's current set → pass
> - If they differ → warn: `[WARN] meta-spec-drift: code produced under meta-spec set {old_sha}, current is {new_sha}. Reconciliation may be needed.`
> - Warn only, do not block. The code may be valid even under the new meta-spec set (many meta-spec changes are additive or don't affect existing code).
>
> If a workspace admin wants to block merges during reconciliation, they set the workspace merge policy to `require_current_meta_spec_set: true`. This converts the warning to a hard block.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add meta-spec drift check to merge processor** (`crates/gyre-server/src/merge_processor.rs`):
   - Before processing an MR, retrieve the MR's attestation (if present) and check `meta_spec_set_sha`
   - Compare against the workspace's current meta-spec set SHA
   - If they differ, add a `[WARN] meta-spec-drift` entry to the MR's gate results
   - The warning is informational by default (does not block merge)

2. **Add workspace merge policy option**:
   - Add `require_current_meta_spec_set: bool` to workspace settings or merge policy
   - When true, meta-spec drift converts from warning to hard block (MR stays in queue until reconciled or overridden)
   - Default: false (warn only)

3. **Display drift warning in UI**:
   - MergeQueueGraph component should show drift warnings alongside other gate results
   - Warning badge: "Meta-spec drift: produced under v{old}, current is v{new}"

4. **Add API for workspace merge policy** (if not already covered by workspace settings):
   - This may be part of existing workspace settings — check before creating new endpoints

5. **Tests**:
   - Unit test: matching meta_spec_set_sha → no warning
   - Unit test: mismatched SHA → warning added to gate results
   - Unit test: `require_current_meta_spec_set: true` → hard block on mismatch
   - Unit test: MR without attestation → skip check (no crash)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Merge processor checks meta_spec_set_sha on MRs with attestations
- [ ] Mismatched SHA produces `[WARN] meta-spec-drift` in gate results
- [ ] Warning does not block merge by default
- [ ] `require_current_meta_spec_set: true` workspace setting converts warning to hard block
- [ ] MRs without attestation skip the check gracefully
- [ ] Tests cover match, mismatch, hard-block, and no-attestation cases

## Agent Instructions

- Read `crates/gyre-server/src/merge_processor.rs` for the merge queue processing loop — find where gate checks are evaluated
- Read `crates/gyre-server/src/gate_executor.rs` for how gate results are structured and reported
- Read `crates/gyre-domain/src/attestation.rs` for the MergeAttestation struct (meta_spec_set_sha field)
- Read `crates/gyre-server/src/constraint_check.rs` for existing constraint evaluation (meta_spec_set_sha constraint exists but may not be wired into gates)
- The meta_spec_set_sha is already captured in attestations — the check is comparing it against the workspace's current set SHA
- Follow the existing gate result pattern for adding the drift warning
