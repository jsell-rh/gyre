## Spec Excerpt

ui-layout.md §9 defines the meta-specs preview loop layout using the Editor Split (§2):

**State 1 — Editing**: Left panel shows persona/principle editor + LLM chat input. Right panel shows target spec selector (checkbox list of specs from repos in workspace). [Preview] and [Publish] buttons.

**State 2 — Preview Running**: Left panel locked during preview (shows diff of changes). Right panel shows per-spec progress indicators (◐ running, ✓ complete). [Cancel Preview] button.

**State 3 — Preview Complete**: Left panel shows editor with changes + LLM suggestion blocks. Right panel has [Architecture] / [Code Diff] tabs. Architecture tab shows structural impact (+ added, ~ modified, = unchanged). [Iterate] returns to State 1 with results visible. [Publish] triggers approval flow.

The preview loop is the primary meta-spec interaction: edit → preview → iterate → publish. Each iteration spawns agents on throwaway branches.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Wire EditorSplit into MetaSpecs.svelte**:
   - Replace current meta-spec editor with EditorSplit component (from task-172)
   - Add target spec selector in right panel (State 1)
   - Connect to existing meta-spec API endpoints

2. **Preview workflow**:
   - [Preview] button triggers agents on throwaway branches (use existing preview API)
   - Show per-spec progress in right panel (State 2)
   - Lock editor during preview, show diff of pending changes
   - [Cancel Preview] aborts running agents

3. **Preview results display** (State 3):
   - Architecture tab: structural impact delta (added/modified/removed/unchanged nodes)
   - Code Diff tab: line-level diff from throwaway branches
   - [Iterate] returns to State 1 with results still visible
   - [Publish] commits change and triggers approval workflow

4. **LLM suggestion integration**:
   - LLM chat input produces inline diff blocks (via `specs/assist` endpoint)
   - Accept/Edit/Dismiss buttons per suggestion

5. **Tests**:
   - State machine transitions (1→2→3→1)
   - Preview cancellation
   - Architecture delta display

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Meta-spec editing uses EditorSplit layout
- [ ] Target spec selector with checkbox list in right panel
- [ ] Preview triggers agent runs, shows per-spec progress
- [ ] Editor locked during preview with diff display
- [ ] Preview results show Architecture and Code Diff tabs
- [ ] [Iterate] returns to editing with results visible
- [ ] [Publish] triggers approval workflow
- [ ] Tests pass for state transitions

## Agent Instructions

Read `ui-layout.md` §9 for the exact wireframes of all three states. Also read `meta-spec-reconciliation.md` §5 for the preview loop protocol. The existing `MetaSpecs.svelte` has the registry view and basic editing — this task adds the full EditorSplit preview workflow. Check the preview API endpoints: the spec mentions throwaway branches and agent spawning. Use the EditorSplit component created in task-172.
