## Spec Excerpt

From `source-control.md` §4:

> When the target branch moves (because another agent's MR merged), jj automatically rebases the agent's in-progress work. With git, the agent must manually `git fetch && git rebase`, handle conflicts, and continue. In a system with 20+ agents pushing concurrently, the baseline moves constantly. jj handles this transparently.

Current state: The speculative merge system (`speculative_merge.rs`) detects conflicts when the target branch moves, but it does not trigger an automatic `jj rebase` on the agent's working branch. Conflict detection is passive — the agent must manually handle the rebase.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Rebase trigger in merge processor:**
   - After a successful merge (MR lands on default branch), identify all other in-flight agents targeting the same branch
   - For each affected agent, trigger a `jj rebase` operation on their working change
   - This should run in `gyre-server/src/merge_processor.rs` after the merge commit

2. **jj rebase adapter (`gyre-adapters/src/jj_ops.rs`):**
   - Add `jj_rebase(repo_path, revision, destination)` function
   - Execute `jj rebase -r <revision> -d <destination>` in the agent's worktree
   - Capture and return rebase result (success, conflict, or error)

3. **Conflict handling:**
   - If rebase produces conflicts, emit a `SpeculativeConflict` event
   - Set the conflict state on the agent's MergeQueueEntry
   - Notify the agent via WebSocket message (MessageKind::Escalation or similar)
   - Agent can continue working on non-conflicting files (jj conflict-as-state model)

4. **Agent notification:**
   - After successful rebase, send a WebSocket notification to the agent informing it the baseline moved
   - Include the new base commit SHA in the notification
   - After conflict rebase, send conflict details with affected file list

5. **Safeguards:**
   - Only rebase agents that are in Active status (not Dead/Completed)
   - Skip rebase if the agent's worktree path doesn't exist
   - Log all rebase operations for audit trail
   - Rate-limit rebases: if target moves multiple times in quick succession, batch into one rebase

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `jj_rebase` function added to jj_ops adapter
- [ ] After MR merge, in-flight agents on same target branch are automatically rebased
- [ ] Conflicts from rebase are surfaced as state (not errors)
- [ ] Agents notified via WebSocket of baseline movement
- [ ] Rebase skipped for dead/completed agents
- [ ] Rebase operations logged
- [ ] `cargo test --all` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/source-control.md` §4 for the full spec. The jj adapter is in `gyre-adapters/src/jj_ops.rs` — add `jj_rebase` alongside existing `jj_new`, `jj_undo`, etc. The merge processor is in `gyre-server/src/merge_processor.rs` — the post-merge hook is where rebase should be triggered. The speculative merge system is in `gyre-server/src/speculative_merge.rs` for conflict detection patterns. WebSocket messaging is in `gyre-server/src/ws.rs`. Agent worktree paths are tracked in `agent_tracking.rs`.
