## Spec Excerpt

**Specs View Layout (§6)**: Full-Width layout. Tenant/workspace scope: sortable table (Path, Status, Kind, Owner, Last Updated). Repo scope: spec list with implementation progress (path, status, task progress bar). Click spec → detail panel with tabs: Content, Edit, Progress, Links, History. New spec creation via `[+ New Spec]` → Editor Split. Data from `GET /api/v1/specs?workspace_id=` and per-spec endpoints.

**Inbox Layout (§7)**: Cards with priority badge, description, workspace attribution, timestamp. Accordion expand shows full context (uncertainty text, related spec, agent info) with action buttons per item type (10 priority levels). Expanded cards include inline action buttons: Respond, View Spec, Approve, Reject, Retry, Override, etc.

**Briefing Layout (§8)**: Full-width narrative with sections: COMPLETED, IN PROGRESS, CROSS-WORKSPACE, EXCEPTIONS, METRICS. Action buttons inline in narrative. Entity references (spec, agent, MR names) are clickable → open detail panel. "Ask about this briefing" chat input at bottom.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Specs View compliance** (`SpecDashboard.svelte`):
   - Verify spec list matches spec: Path, Status, Progress bar, Last Activity columns
   - Detail panel tabs: Content, Edit, Progress, Links, History
   - `[+ New Spec]` button opens Editor Split (depends on task-172)
   - `?owner=me` toggle and status filters

2. **Inbox Layout compliance** (`Inbox.svelte`):
   - Verify card structure: priority badge, description, workspace/repo attribution, timestamp
   - Accordion expand with full context
   - Action buttons per all 10 priority levels (per HSI §8 priority table)
   - Workspace attribution badges at tenant scope

3. **Briefing Layout compliance** (`Briefing.svelte`):
   - Verify section structure: COMPLETED, IN PROGRESS, CROSS-WORKSPACE, EXCEPTIONS, METRICS
   - Entity references as clickable links → detail panel
   - "Ask about this briefing" chat input
   - Time range selector

4. **Tests**:
   - Spec list renders with progress bars
   - Inbox accordion expands with correct action buttons
   - Briefing narrative renders all sections

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Specs view renders sortable table with implementation progress
- [ ] Spec detail panel has Content/Edit/Progress/Links/History tabs
- [ ] Inbox cards show priority badge, description, attribution, timestamp
- [ ] Inbox accordion shows action buttons for all 10 priority levels
- [ ] Briefing renders COMPLETED/IN PROGRESS/CROSS-WORKSPACE/EXCEPTIONS/METRICS sections
- [ ] Entity references in briefing are clickable (open detail panel)
- [ ] Tests pass

## Agent Instructions

Read `ui-layout.md` §6-§8 for the exact layout specifications. Also reference `human-system-interface.md` §8 for the full inbox priority table (10 item types with their action buttons). The existing `SpecDashboard.svelte`, `Inbox.svelte`, and `Briefing.svelte` are the starting points — this task is about aligning them with the spec's layout requirements, not building from scratch. Check the data source endpoints mentioned in the spec: `GET /api/v1/specs`, `GET /api/v1/users/me/notifications`, `GET /api/v1/workspaces/:id/briefing`.
