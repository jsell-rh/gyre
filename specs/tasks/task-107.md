## Spec Excerpt

From `identity-security.md` §Layer 3:

> **Keyless commit signing** via Sigstore. An agent with an OIDC identity gets a short-lived signing certificate from Fulcio. Every commit is cryptographically signed — the signature proves which agent, on which task, spawned by which user, made the commit. No long-lived GPG keys to manage or rotate. Signatures recorded in **Rekor transparency log** (public or private instance) for non-repudiation.

Current state: `commit_signatures.rs` uses local Ed25519 signing. The mode can be set to "fulcio" but falls back to local with a warning log. No actual Fulcio certificate issuance, no Rekor transparency log integration.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fulcio certificate issuance (`gyre-server/src/commit_signatures.rs`):**
   - Implement the Fulcio signing flow:
     a. Agent has an OIDC JWT (from Gyre's OIDC provider)
     b. Request short-lived signing certificate from Fulcio using the JWT
     c. Use the certificate to sign the git commit
     d. Certificate is ephemeral — no key management
   - Use the `sigstore` Rust crate if available, or implement HTTP calls to Fulcio API
   - Configure Fulcio URL via `GYRE_FULCIO_URL` env var (default: public Fulcio instance)

2. **Rekor transparency log:**
   - After signing, record the signature in Rekor for non-repudiation
   - Configure Rekor URL via `GYRE_REKOR_URL` env var
   - Support both public Rekor and private instances
   - Store the Rekor log entry ID alongside the commit signature for later verification

3. **Verification endpoint:**
   - Add verification logic that checks:
     a. The commit signature is valid
     b. The signing certificate was issued by the expected Fulcio instance
     c. The certificate's OIDC subject matches the expected agent identity
     d. A matching Rekor entry exists (non-repudiation)
   - Surface verification status in provenance chain API

4. **Configuration:**
   - `GYRE_SIGNING_MODE`: `local` (default, current behavior), `fulcio` (real Sigstore), `none` (skip signing)
   - `GYRE_FULCIO_URL`: Fulcio instance URL
   - `GYRE_REKOR_URL`: Rekor instance URL
   - Fall back gracefully to local signing if Fulcio is unreachable (with warning)

5. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests with mocked Fulcio/Rekor responses
   - Integration test with local Sigstore stack (if practical)
   - Test fallback behavior when Fulcio is unreachable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Fulcio certificate issuance using agent OIDC JWT
- [x] Commits signed with Fulcio-issued certificate
- [x] Signatures recorded in Rekor transparency log
- [x] Verification endpoint checks certificate chain and Rekor entry
- [x] Configurable via GYRE_SIGNING_MODE, GYRE_FULCIO_URL, GYRE_REKOR_URL
- [x] Graceful fallback to local signing when Fulcio unreachable
- [x] `cargo test --all` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/identity-security.md` §Layer 3. The current signing implementation is in `gyre-server/src/commit_signatures.rs`. The OIDC provider is in `gyre-server/src/oidc.rs` — agents already have JWTs that can be presented to Fulcio. Check if the `sigstore` crate is available in the Rust ecosystem (crates.io). The provenance chain API may be in `gyre-server/src/api/` — grep for `provenance` or `attestation`. Git push processing is in `gyre-server/src/git_http.rs`.

## Shipped

Fulcio keyless commit signing with Rekor transparency-log recording,
implementing every plan item and every review finding from the prior
rounds (F1-F19).

### Behavior

- **Fulcio issuance** (`sigstore.rs::sign_commit_keyless`): ephemeral
  rcgen P-256 key pair per squash, proof-of-possession (base64 DER
  ECDSA over the JWT `sub`) verified by the receiving Fulcio, and
  `publicKey.content` sent as PEM text - the encoding upstream
  Fulcio's `challenges.ParsePublicKey` accepts. The caller's validated
  agent JWT (`AuthenticatedAgent.bearer_token`) is presented to
  Fulcio; the response's `signedCertificateEmbeddedSct`/`DetachedSct`
  chain is decoded (PEM text, raw DER, then base64(DER) - mutually
  unambiguous) and stored leaf-first.
- **Attribution** (F2): `SigningAttribution::from_auth` threads the
  caller's validated JWT claims (`task_id`, `spawned_by`, agent id)
  into the record; non-JWT callers get the resolved agent id with
  empty (not fabricated) task/user fields.
- **Verification** (`verify_signature_fulcio`, exposed at
  `GET /api/v1/repos/:id/commits/:sha/signature/verification` and as
  Phase 6 of the provenance chain verification - F6): four phases with
  trust anchors resolved ONLY from server `SigningConfig` (F3), chain
  validation against EVERY chain in the Fulcio trust bundle (F11) with
  `not_before`/`not_after` enforcement on every stored certificate
  (F5), SAN/CN subject match, and a Rekor check that fetches the entry
  and compares its hashedrekord body's digest, signature, and
  certificate against THIS record (F4 - content match, not existence).
- **Rekor recording**: hashedrekord entry (commit digest, base64 DER
  signature, base64 PEM leaf certificate) POSTed at sign time; the
  returned entry UUID is stored with the record.
- **Persistence** (F9): `CommitSignatureRepository` port with SQLite
  and PostgreSQL adapters (migration `2026-10-09-000056`), keyed by
  `(repo_id, commit_sha)`, wired through `store!` in `build_state`.
- **Latency bound** (F10): every outbound Fulcio/Rekor call is wrapped
  in `tokio::time::timeout(SIGNING_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECS = 10)`.
- **ABAC** (F8): the verification route is registered in
  `ResourceResolver::routes` (`repo`/read).
- **Configuration**: `GYRE_SIGNING_MODE` (`local`/`fulcio`/`none`),
  `GYRE_FULCIO_URL`, `GYRE_REKOR_URL`, via `SigningConfig::from_env`.
- **Operator key provisioning** (F12 + this round): the forge Ed25519
  key is persisted in the durable KV store across restarts, and
  `GYRE_AGENT_SIGNING_KEY` (base64 PKCS#8 DER, **v1 or v2** -
  `docs/server-config.md` documents the row and a working generation
  command) explicitly provisions/rotates it. Invalid material is a
  hard startup error.
- **Tests** (F7): the mock stack encodes the upstream wire contract
  (rejects base64(DER) keys like real Fulcio, verifies PoP for real,
  serves a two-chain trust bundle, echoes stored Rekor entries) with
  failure knobs per phase; negative coverage for all four verification
  phases; handler-level fallback/attribution/none-mode tests through
  the real router; an independent upstream-conformance probe
  (`tests/task107_upstream_conformance.rs`) drives the production
  sign/verify paths against a Fulcio built from upstream proto
  documentation.

### This round (rebase repair onto base `66a5fc67`, head `c46c96579`)

- **Base merge resolution**: the assigned repair rebased the branch onto
  the assignment base `66a5fc67` (task-075 LSP call graph + task-102
  trusted-proxy main). Three conflicts, resolved in the task's favor
  where the base carried the pre-task-107 stub:
  - `crates/gyre-server/src/lib.rs` / `mem.rs` `AppState`: kept the
    port-backed `commit_signatures: Arc<dyn CommitSignatureRepository>`
    and `signing_config: SigningConfig` fields (the task-107
    implementation) and dropped the base's stale in-memory
    `CommitSignatureStore`/`sigstore_mode` duplicates — the base side
    predates the task and its fields would have shadowed the real
    implementation; took the base's new `trusted_proxies` field
    (task-102, required by `trusted_proxy.rs`/`middleware.rs` merged
    in from the base).
  - `web/dist/assets/elk.bundled-DuGOUTHE.js`: regenerated build
    artifact, resolved to the base's bundle (no frontend source changes
    on this branch; the executor restores web/dist from the base and
    final integration republishes).
- `cargo check -p gyre-server -p gyre-adapters --all-targets` passes at
  the merged head — the base's `middleware.rs`/`main.rs` trusted-proxy
  wiring and the task's signing surface compile together with no
  reference to the dropped stub fields.
- F19 (upstream Fulcio trust-bundle protojson `CertificateChain` object
  shape) and F12-F17 from prior rounds remain in place at the merged
  head, re-verified by the focused suites below.

### Verification evidence (head `c46c96579`, under /tmp/stage/review-evidence/)

Focused suites at the merged head: `merge-focused-tests.txt` —
sigstore 17/17 (including the F19 shape test), commit_signatures 6/6,
api::provenance 5/5, `task107_signing_key_persistence` 1/1;
`merge-focused-tests-integration.txt` — `task107_upstream_conformance`
3/3 and `task107_signing_key_env` 1/1. `cargo check -p gyre-server -p
gyre-adapters --all-targets` exits 0. Full workspace suites,
architecture checks, all-target Clippy, and GitHub CI are owned by
verification/publication; live Fulcio interop remains blocked by
sandbox network policy (fulcio.sigstore.dev:443 connect refused,
prior-round `f19-live-verification.txt`); exact-head GitHub CI is
mandatory after review.
