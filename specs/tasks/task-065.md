## Spec Excerpt

**explorer-canvas.md §1 Problem:** The current implementation has two separate tabs (Graph, Flow) that are the same canvas rendered twice with different overlays. The spec says these should be one view with lens toggles — the topology is constant, the overlay changes.

**explorer-canvas.md §2–3 Design:** The Explorer canvas is a single interactive surface. The knowledge graph topology (nodes + edges) is always visible. A lens toggle in the toolbar controls what data is overlaid. Three lenses: Structural (default), Evaluative, Observable (future, grayed out).

**explorer-canvas.md §8 Component Architecture:**
```
MoldableView
  ├── Explorer tab (merged Graph + Flow)
  │     ├── LensToggle (Structural / Evaluative / Observable)
  │     ├── ExplorerCanvas (SVG graph layer — always rendered)
  │     ├── EvaluativeOverlay (Canvas 2D particles — rendered when lens=evaluative)
  │     │     └── PlaybackControls (play/pause, scrubber, speed)
  │     ├── NodeBadge (SVG overlay — metrics per node)
  │     └── Breadcrumb (drill-down path)
  ├── List tab (unchanged)
  └── Timeline tab (unchanged)
```

**explorer-implementation.md §17 ExplorerCanvas (Svelte) Props:**
```typescript
{
  repoId: string;
  nodes: GraphNode[];
  edges: GraphEdge[];
  activeQuery: ViewQuery | null;
  filter: 'all' | 'endpoints' | 'types' | 'calls' | 'dependencies';
  lens: 'structural' | 'evaluative' | 'observable';
}
```

Responsibilities: Semantic zoom treemap rendering (canvas 2D), pan/zoom/click/drag interaction, view query resolution and rendering, filter preset application, lens overlay, minimap.

**explorer-implementation.md §25 Phase 1: Canvas + Filters:**
- Build ExplorerCanvas from the prototype (`explore3.html`)
- Semantic zoom treemap with path tree hierarchy
- Filter presets (All, Endpoints, Types, Calls, Dependencies)
- Three lenses (structural, evaluative, observable)
- View query renderer (scope, emphasis, groups, callouts, narrative)
- Replace MoldableView's Graph + Flow tabs with single component

## Implementation Plan

### Existing Code

- `web/src/lib/ExplorerCanvas.svelte` (6049 lines) — already implements semantic zoom treemap with lens toggle, filters, evaluative overlay, breadcrumb, etc.
- `web/src/components/ExplorerView.svelte` (3729 lines) — container component
- `web/src/components/ExplorerFilterPanel.svelte` — filter panel
- Various supporting components: `PlaybackControls`, `TimelineScrubber`, `NodeBadge`, `Breadcrumb`, `EvaluativeOverlay`, `ObservableBanner`

### Work Required

1. **Audit ExplorerCanvas.svelte** against the spec's prop interface. Verify it accepts: `repoId`, `nodes`, `edges`, `activeQuery`, `filter`, `lens`. Check that all filter presets work: `all`, `endpoints`, `types`, `calls`, `dependencies`.

2. **Verify semantic zoom treemap**: The canvas should render nodes as a treemap grouped by package/module hierarchy. Double-click zooms into children. Pan/zoom via mouse/trackpad.

3. **Verify lens toggle**: Three buttons in toolbar — Structural (active by default), Evaluative (available), Observable (grayed out with "Requires production telemetry integration" label).

4. **Verify view query rendering**: When `activeQuery` is set, the canvas should:
   - Resolve scope → result set of nodes
   - Apply emphasis (highlight, dim, tiered_colors, heat, badges)
   - Render groups as labeled clusters
   - Render callouts as annotated nodes
   - Render narrative as numbered sequence
   - Show annotation title/description

5. **Verify no separate Graph/Flow tabs**: MoldableView should have a single Explorer tab, not separate Graph and Flow tabs.

6. **Minimap**: Verify the canvas has a minimap showing the full graph with viewport indicator.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single Explorer tab replaces separate Graph + Flow tabs
- [ ] Lens toggle shows three options: Structural (default), Evaluative, Observable (disabled)
- [ ] Filter presets work: All, Endpoints, Types, Calls, Dependencies
- [ ] Semantic zoom treemap renders nodes grouped by hierarchy
- [ ] View query rendering applies scope, emphasis, groups, callouts, narrative, annotation
- [ ] Pan/zoom/click/drag interactions work
- [ ] Minimap is present
- [ ] Props match spec: `repoId`, `nodes`, `edges`, `activeQuery`, `filter`, `lens`
- [ ] `cd web && npm test` passes

## Agent Instructions

Read `specs/system/explorer-canvas.md` §1–3, §8 and `specs/system/explorer-implementation.md` §1–2, §17, §25. Then read the existing implementation:
- `web/src/lib/ExplorerCanvas.svelte` — the main canvas component
- `web/src/components/ExplorerView.svelte` — the container
- `web/src/components/ExplorerFilterPanel.svelte` — filter panel

The existing code is 6000+ lines and likely implements most of this spec. Your job is to **audit and complete**, not rewrite. Check each acceptance criterion against the code. Fix gaps. Run `cd web && npm test` to verify.

Key question: Does the current ExplorerView still have separate Graph/Flow tabs, or has it already been unified? If separate tabs remain, merge them into a single Explorer view.
